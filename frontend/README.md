# TT-Line Route Finder - Frontend

A modern, responsive React application built with TypeScript for finding optimal transportation routes between locations. This frontend implements cutting-edge React patterns, state management best practices, and a component-driven architecture for maintainable and scalable code.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### **Modern React Architecture**
The frontend follows **React 19** best practices with a component-driven, hook-based architecture using React Query, Zustand, Tanstack Router and shadcn.

## üöÄ Key Features

### **Modern React Patterns**
- **React 19** with latest features and optimizations
- **TypeScript** for type safety and developer experience
- **Custom Hooks** for reusable business logic
- **Component Composition** for flexible UI building

### **Routing & Navigation**
- **TanStack Router** for type-safe routing
- **File-based routing** for intuitive route organization
- **Nested layouts** for consistent UI structure
- **Route protection** with authentication guards

### **State Management**
- **React Query (TanStack Query)** for server state
- **Zustand** for lightweight client state
- **Custom hooks** for local component state
- **Optimistic updates** for better UX

### **Data Tables & UI**
- **TanStack Table** for powerful data tables
- **shadcn/ui** components for consistent design
- **Responsive design** with Tailwind CSS
- **Accessibility** built into all components

### **Authentication & Security**
- **JWT token management** with secure storage
- **Protected routes** with authentication guards
- **Secure API calls** with authorization headers



## üîß Installation & Setup

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### **Installation Steps**
```bash
cd /frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Generate router types (if route structure changes)
npm run router:generate
```


## üîç Key Design Decisions

### **Why TanStack Router?**
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with route types
- **Performance**: Lightweight and fast routing
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent DX with file-based routing
- **Modern Features**: Built for React 18+ concurrent features

### **Why React Query + Zustand?**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Server state vs client state
- **Performance**: Intelligent caching and background updates
- **Developer Experience**: Simple APIs with powerful features
- **Bundle Size**: Lightweight alternatives to heavy state libraries

### **Why shadcn/ui?**
- **Quality**: High-quality, accessible components
- **Customization**: Easy to customize with Tailwind CSS
- **Consistency**: Unified design system across components
- **Accessibility**: Built-in accessibility features

### **Why Custom Hooks?**
- **Reusability**: Business logic shared across components
- **Testability**: Easy to unit test isolated logic
- **Separation**: UI logic separated from business logic
- **Composition**: Complex logic composed from simple hooks



## üìà Future Enhancements

### **Planned Features**
- **Advanced Filtering**: Complex filter combinations
- **Route Visualization**: Interactive route maps
- **Offline Support**: Service worker for offline functionality

### **Performance Improvements**
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large data tables
- **Bundle Splitting**: Route-based code splitting
